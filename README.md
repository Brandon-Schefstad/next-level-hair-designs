# Next Level Hair Designs

Freelance client requested a website for her personal business. She is a hairstylist and needed the website to allow for an image gallery, pricing menu, and a separate page for booking. It also needed to be built for minimal maintenance and to run completely from a movile device. Booking is handled through a third-party platform. Site is created from a mobile-first approach since the client does not have access to a computer currently.

## Project Status

Base design is finished, still waiting on editing response from the client for recent changes. Customers are able to see the images for each design as well as prices. When visiting the booking page users can select their preferred hairstyle and time slot.

## Reflection

-   What did you set out to build?
    This is an ongoing freelance and pro-bono project where I aim to build a responsive, stable website that requires minimal maintenance or upkeep. The client does not have access to a computer currently so I had to take that into consideration during wireframing and conceptualization . Moreover her styles require different lengths of time so the booking software needed to have a variety of appointment types.

    This was my first full website using ReactJS and my first time using React-router. It really taught me how to use the UseState hook and how to abstract out similar elements into components with different properties.

    The technologies implemented in this project are ReactJS(via create-react-app), React-Router 4.0, SASS for styling, as well as integration with a third party booking system. Images are stored within the app itself but could be extracted out to a hosting site.
